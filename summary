1. U.S. 2s10s Steepener vs Long Regional Banks (KRE)
Macro View

The 2s10s curve has been inverted for over two years — historically unsustainable.

As the Fed nears the end of its hiking cycle, front-end yields (2y) will fall faster than the long end.

Treasury supply pressures + sticky term premia will keep 10y yields from falling as quickly.

Trade Structure

Rates leg: 2s10s steepener via paying 2y swaps / receiving 10y swaps, or TU vs TY futures.

Equities leg: Long KRE ETF (U.S. regional banks).

Rationale

Steeper curves improve net interest margins for banks — regionals are most sensitive due to reliance on deposit funding.

Post-SVB, regionals trade at cheap valuations and offer high operating leverage to curve shape changes.

Catalysts

Fed pivot to cuts in 2025.

Softening U.S. labour data, ISM weakness.

Risks

Hard landing → credit losses offset NIM gains.

Fed delays cuts, keeping inversion longer than expected.

2. Japan JGB 5s30s Steepener vs Long Topix Banks
Macro View

BoJ is in the early stages of policy normalisation after decades of ultra-loose policy and Yield Curve Control (YCC).

Inflation above 2% and strong wage growth give them cover to tighten.

Removing YCC and reducing bond purchases → long-end yields rise faster than intermediate maturities.

Trade Structure

Rates leg: 5s30s steepener via paying 5y JGB swaps / receiving 30y, or futures-based curve trade.

Equities leg: Long Topix Banks Index or Japanese bank-heavy ETFs.

Rationale

Steeper curves improve Japanese banks’ lending margins after decades of flat yield curves.

Structural policy shift makes this more than a short-term trade.

Catalysts

BoJ announcements on rate hikes or YCC removal.

Wage settlement data sustaining inflation narrative.

Risks

BoJ moves more slowly than expected.

Global risk-off → safe-haven flows flatten the curve.

3. Brazil 2s10s Steepener vs Long Brazilian Utilities
Macro View

Brazil’s Selic rate peaked at 13.75% and is now at ~10.50%, with more cuts expected.

Fiscal risks (high debt/GDP, persistent deficits) keep long-end yields elevated despite easing.

Classic post-hiking-cycle bull steepening setup: front end falls, long end anchored.

Trade Structure

Rates leg: 2s10s steepener via paying 10y DI futures / receiving 2y DI, or BRL swaps.

Equities leg: Long Bovespa Utilities Index or key names like Eletrobras, Engie Brasil.

Rationale

Utilities benefit directly from falling front-end rates through cheaper financing.

Defensive sector well-suited for slower growth phase of cycle.

Catalysts

BCB accelerating rate cuts.

Stable BRL reducing imported inflation risks.

Risks

Fiscal blowout steepens long end too aggressively → equity rally offset by macro instability.

Political intervention in utility pricing.
