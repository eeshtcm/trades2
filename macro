United States (USD)
Policy & macro data (front‑end driver)

Fed policy rate: held at 4.25–4.50% at the July meeting; statement didn’t pre‑commit to cuts. Markets now price a September cut after softer data. 
Reuters
+1

Inflation: July CPI +0.2% m/m, 2.7% y/y; core 3.1% y/y—good enough to keep a Sept cut on the table, but tariffs are showing up in tariff‑sensitive goods. 
Reuters
+1

Labor market: July payrolls +73k, unemployment 4.2%, plus downward revisions to prior months—clear cooling that’s pushed the market toward sooner easing. 
Reuters

Balance sheet / liquidity (front‑end plumbing)

QT slowed (Mar): the Fed reduced the pace of balance‑sheet run‑off, explicitly to manage liquidity—important for o/n rates, repo, and OIS/funding spreads. Officials subsequently signaled they can run QT to a “natural” end at a slower clip. 
Reuters
+1

Curve & long‑end (swaps desk drivers)

Supply & term premium: strategists expect heavy Treasury issuance in H2 (potentially up to ~$1T) and widening deficits (new tax/spending bill) to lean upward on long yields even as the front‑end prices cuts. 
Reuters
+1

Forecasts: surveys through July/Aug point to range‑bound yields near‑term but with risk of mild bear‑steepening on tariffs + supply. 
Reuters
+1

Volatility: despite politics/tariffs, rates vol (MOVE) has sagged to multi‑year lows—important for options/convexity supply. 
Reuters

Bottom line for trading

STIRT: meeting‑dated SOFR OIS now mostly a labor‑led cuts trade (cooling jobs + acceptable inflation). Watch CPI/PCE and payrolls for repricing of the next 1–2 meetings. 
Reuters
+1

Swaps: balance Fed easing vs. heavy duration supply; tariffs risk higher long‑run inflation term premium, nudging steeper curves even if the front‑end eases. 
Reuters

Euro area (EUR)
Policy & macro data

ECB: after a year of easing (deposit rate cut down to 2.0%), the ECB paused in July and signaled a high bar for further 2025 cuts. Markets trimmed cut odds into September.

Inflation: headline running near 2% (July around target); core roughly stable—giving the Governing Council cover to sit pat while watching trade‑war headlines.

Balance sheet / technicals

PEPP reinvestments ended at end‑2024; ECB no longer a systematic buyer—changes the net supply/term‑premium mix through 2025. 
European Central Bank

Primary markets: despite less ECB support, syndications were very well bid in January; more recently official institutions’ buying rose—both relevant for ASW and relative‑value vs swaps. 
Reuters
+1

Bottom line for trading

STIRT: with inflation at target and the ECB on hold, meeting‑dated €STR OIS is now about timing/size of any additional cuts vs the tariff/growth backdrop. The ECB has raised the bar—carry/roll dominates unless data break. 
Reuters

Swaps: removal of ECB reinvestments + decent gross sovereign supply keeps ASW dynamics interesting; relative value to USTs can swing with trade news and growth surprises. 
Reuters

United Kingdom (GBP)
Policy & macro data

BoE: cut Bank Rate to 4.0% on Aug 7 by a razor‑thin vote; minutes showed a divided MPC and markets pared the pace of further 2025 cuts. 
Reuters
+1

Inflation: UK CPI re‑accelerated to 3.6% y/y in June, keeping UK above the U.S./euro area; wage growth ~5% and hiring cooling—an awkward mix that explains the split vote. 
Reuters
+1

Expectations: Citi/YouGov short‑term inflation expectations nudged up in July—sticky expectations slow the easing path. 
Reuters

Supply, QT & market structure

Gilt remit 2025/26: ~£299bn issuance; shift away from long‑dated supply toward the short bucket—directly affects curve shape and long ASW. 
Reuters
+1

BoE QT: active QT continues; BoE estimates QT has lifted 10y gilt yields by ~15–25bp (some argue more). Discussion about slowing QT and/or dialing back long‑dated sales has intensified.

Bottom line for trading

STIRT: UK front‑end is a tug‑of‑war—cooling activity vs still‑elevated CPI and wages. Meeting‑dated SONIA trades are sensitive to wage, services CPI, PMIs. 
Reuters
+1

Swaps: QT + remit mix and sticky inflation risk keep UK term premium relatively punchy vs EUR; watch ASW (supply, LDI demand, QT pace) and 5s10s/10s30s for steepening risk if the BoE cuts while supply/QT lean the other way.

Cross‑market themes to keep in your head on the desk
“Cuts up front, supply in the back.” U.S. and UK markets price front‑end easing on cooling growth, but heavy sovereign issuance/QT and tariff uncertainty can prop up the long end → bias to curve steepening on shocks. 
Reuters
+1

Tariffs = asymmetric risk. In the U.S. (and via spillover to Europe), tariffs add sticky goods inflation risk even as growth softens—keeps term premium from collapsing. 
Reuters

Liquidity/vol: Fed slowed QT, o/n plumbing stable; MOVE at multi‑year lows—carry/roll trades have worked, but low vol = fragility if a shock hits (tariff escalation, weak payrolls, EU‑US trade headlines). 
Reuters
+1

ECB on hold, BoE divided, Fed poised. ECB’s bar for more cuts is high; BoE is split with inflation still > target; the Fed is closest to a first cut (data‑dependent). That’s your relative‑value framework for USD‑EUR‑GBP front‑end.

How to use this tomorrow
On STIRT, translate each new data point into meeting‑dated OIS moves (how many bp cut/hike implied) and probability trees.

On Swaps, map headlines to curve shape (steepener vs flattener), ASW (supply/QT vs demand), and cross‑market RV (UST vs Bund vs Gilt).

For basis/FX‑rates crossover, watch funding prints and quarter‑end dynamics—tariff/collateral shocks hit short‑end basis first.

If you want, I can turn this into a 1‑page cheat sheet with the current policy levels, next‑meeting dates, and “what moves the strip” for each region so you can keep it on screen.
