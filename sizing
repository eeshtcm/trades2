1. Establishing DV01 Benchmarks
We need DV01 (i.e. dollar value of a one basis point move) estimates for the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasuries:

The 10-year U.S. Treasury has a DV01 of approximately $76.55 per $1 million par

The 2-year U.S. Treasury has a DV01 of approximately $36.97 per $1 million par

.

Therefore, for every $1 million in notional:

10-year gives ~$76.55 per bp,

2-year gives ~$36.97 per bp.

The steepener DV01 (10y long, 2y short) is the difference:

​
 =76.55−36.97=$39.58 per bp per $1M notional
So a $1M position in the spread yields ~$39.6 of P&L per basis point move.

2. Translating DV01 into Risk Sizing
You want balanced risk exposure between the equity (KRE) component and the rates spread.

A. Define your desired P&L sensitivity
Let’s say you want the steepener to move $X for every 1 bp change in the spread.

Example: if you consider a 20 bp adverse move in the spread could cost you $500k, then:

 ≈$632M
That’s the notional you'd need for that DV01 exposure.

B. Match equity leg with comparable risk
Say you anticipate KRE could move ±10% in your timeframe. If you want symmetric $500k P&L expectation:

KRE notional

So equity leg notional would be about $5M.

3. Example Sizing Table
Leg	DV01 per $1M	Threshold Move	Sensitivity / $M Notional	Resulting Risk (± move)
Rates “10y–2y”	$39.58/bp	20 bp	$39.58 × N (in millions)	$39.58 × 20 × (N/1M)
Example: N=$632M	—	—	~$25k per bp	~$500k
KRE Equity Leg	—	±10%	N × 10%	$500k if N=$5M

4. Summary Recommendation
Desired risk per leg: ~$500k (or your chosen threshold).

Rates leg (steepener): ~$632 million notional (duration-weighted) achieves ~$500k risk for a 20 bp adverse steepener move.

Equity leg (KRE): ~$5 million notional makes a 10% KRE move equal $500k.

Thus you balance both legs fairly in terms of expected P&L impact, making your trade size coherent across asset classes.

Want to adjust?
For a lower risk budget (say $250k per leg), halve both notional estimates (~$316M steepener, $2.5M KRE).

If your conviction differs—say you're more certain on steepening vs KRE—you could instead risk-weight it 2:1 or similar.
