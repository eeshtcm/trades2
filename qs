Market Structure & Products
1. “How do you think about positioning along the curve when the front-end is driven by central bank expectations but the long-end is more about term premium and supply?”

Meaning: In rates trading, short maturities (“front-end”) move mainly with central bank rate expectations. The long-end (10y+) moves more on investor demand, issuance, and inflation term premium. You’re asking how they decide where to take risk — e.g., whether to bet on a steepening/flattening, or just trade one part of the curve.

2. “When do you prefer to express a rates view via OIS rather than futures, and what drives that choice?”

Meaning: OIS (Overnight Index Swaps) directly reflect expected overnight rates, whereas futures (like SOFR futures) are exchange-traded and have different liquidity and margin dynamics. This question gets at product selection: maybe they use OIS for clean rate exposure and futures for liquidity or to hedge flow.

3. “How does meeting-dated OIS liquidity change as you get closer to the meeting, and do you see mispricings between them and futures?”

Meaning: Meeting-dated OIS are niche and not always liquid far ahead of time, but become more active near the meeting. You’re asking whether price differences between MDOIS and futures open up arbitrage or relative value trades.

B. Trading Strategy & Flows
4. “When funding markets are stressed, do you see the cross-currency basis move first in the short end, or does it leak into longer maturities quickly?”

Meaning: Cross-currency basis reflects extra cost/premium to borrow in one currency vs another. In stress (e.g., year-end), the short maturities (1w, 1m) often blow out first. You’re asking if that’s still true and how quickly long-dated basis adjusts.

5. “How do you decide whether to fade or follow a move in asset swap spreads after a QE/QT announcement?”

Meaning: Asset swap spread = bond yield – swap rate. QE/QT changes supply/demand for bonds, moving spreads. Sometimes these moves overshoot and reverse (“fade”), sometimes they persist (“follow”). You’re asking how they make that call.

6. “What are the most important flow drivers for short-dated swaps right now — central bank policy, collateral demand, or client hedging?”

Meaning: Short-dated swaps can move because of expectations for policy, demand for collateral (repo markets), or corporate/sovereign hedging. You’re asking which factor is dominating right now.

C. Risk Management
7. “How do you balance directional rate risk with carry/roll-down opportunities in the short end?”

Meaning: Carry = profit from holding a trade if nothing changes; roll-down = how a bond or swap’s yield changes as it moves along the curve with time. You’re asking how they weigh these steady P&L sources vs outright rate moves.

8. “When the curve moves a lot after a central bank meeting, what’s your process for recalibrating risk across maturities?”

Meaning: Big meetings can reprice not just the nearest meeting, but the whole curve. You’re asking how they adjust positions along the curve to reflect the new environment.

9. “Do you hedge basis risk between currencies directly, or do you leave some residual exposure if you have a strong macro view?”

Meaning: Basis risk = exposure to spread changes between two related products (e.g., USD vs EUR swaps). You’re asking if they run it flat for safety, or leave it open if they think it will move in their favour.

D. Execution & Market Microstructure
10. “What’s the most illiquid point on the curve you trade, and how do you handle risk there compared to the more liquid points?”

Meaning: Some maturities trade heavily (e.g., 2y, 10y), others less so. You’re asking about the hardest-to-trade spots and how they manage risk when exiting might be costly.

11. “Are there specific times of day when you tend to see more flow in meeting-dated products?”

Meaning: Different times (e.g., after economic data releases, London fix) see more activity. This tells you when liquidity is best for niche products.

12. “How do you monitor for dislocations between swaps and cash bonds that might open up asset swap opportunities?”

Meaning: If a bond’s yield diverges too much from the equivalent swap, traders can lock in profit via asset swaps. You’re asking how they spot these in real time.

E. Macro & Policy Insight
13. “How does the market typically reprice the path between meetings when a central bank surprises with guidance rather than a rate move?”

Meaning: Sometimes a CB changes the tone without changing rates. You’re asking how quickly and aggressively traders adjust expectations for future meetings.

14. “Do you think the market is currently over- or under-pricing volatility in the next few meetings, and why?”

Meaning: Policy uncertainty is reflected in implied volatility of rates. You’re asking their opinion on whether current pricing matches reality.

15. “When you look at global central banks, whose meeting cadence or communication style makes them hardest to trade?”

Meaning: Some CBs are predictable (Fed), others more opaque (RBA historically). This gets them to compare styles and how it impacts trading.
