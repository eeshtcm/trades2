1. Economic Activity & Sentiment
Recent data signals a slowdown:

June and July sentiment indicators were downbeat.

FGV industrial confidence fell.

Manufacturing PMI slightly above 48 — consistent with contraction (~-3% y/y output pace). This is a sharp slowdown from ~4% growth last year.

Weakness already visible in 2Q production numbers.

Services PMI dropped 3 points to 46.3 — weakest since 2021.

Outlook for 2Q GDP:

Anticipated weak services output in June → first decline since Jan.

Negative carry-over from Q2 to Q3 of ~-1% q/q saar.

Retail sales expected to recover somewhat in June, but still imply a drop in quarterly consumer goods sales.

Overall: 2Q GDP tracking slightly below previous forecasts.

2. Drivers of Weakness
Contradictory macro forces:

Labour market still tight with high household savings — normally supportive for demand.

BUT corporate balance sheets are weakening, especially under the strain of high interest rates.

Debt service ratio (DSR) elevated — near cycle highs.

External & policy factors:

De-escalation of U.S. tariff tensions last week, but tariffs still seen as a net negative demand shock.

Global slowdown could amplify domestic deceleration.

3. Inflation & Monetary Policy
Inflation trends:

Headline inflation has moderated over the past three months, back within target range for first time in over a year.

Services CPI still “uncomfortably high” but easing since late 2024.

Policy stance:

BCB rhetoric remains hawkish (“high for long”), signalling cuts not imminent.

One board member suggested pause in hiking cycle is temporary, with possible later resumption.

Forecast:

Cuts could start as early as Dec 2025 with an initial 25bp, followed by back-to-back cuts to reach ~10.75% Selic by end-2026.

This path is earlier and deeper than market consensus.

4. Fiscal & Political Landscape
Political backdrop:

Domestic political polarisation increased — protests in both Lower House and Senate following house arrest of former president Jair Bolsonaro.

Congressional leadership assures no obstruction to legislation, but limited clarity on near-term agenda.

Fiscal policy constraints:

Little scope for large budget stimulus given fiscal targets and political division.

Possible targeted measures to offset U.S. tariffs:

Employment protection programs.

Financial support and government purchases of affected products.

These are expected to pass without major resistance, but their macro impact is limited.

Budget timing:

Slightly higher 2025 spending likely, but no major disruption to budget execution this year.

2026 budget proposal due in late August — substantial disbursements would require legal changes, making rapid fiscal expansion unlikely.

Peak political tensions expected in Q4 2025 during budget debates ahead of the 2026 election year.

5. Market Implications from the Note
Growth: Domestic slowdown clearly underway and likely to persist into H2 2025.

Rates:

Softer growth + moderating inflation = room for BCB to cut earlier and deeper than priced.

Hawkish rhetoric is a communications tactic to avoid premature market loosening.

Curve dynamics:

Front end (2y) sensitive to earlier-than-expected cuts → downward pressure.

Long end (10y+) sticky due to fiscal credibility concerns, political noise, and possible global term premia.

FX: Slower cuts than the market hopes for in the short term may limit BRL volatility; global risk sentiment will still matter.

Does This Align with the Brazil 2s10s Steepener vs. Utilities Trade?
Yes — strongly.

Rates leg:

Front end → likely to fall when BCB begins cuts in Dec 2025 or earlier if slowdown deepens faster.

Long end → supported by fiscal risk, political uncertainty, and possible external rate stickiness → curve steepening bias.

Equities leg (utilities):

Utilities are domestic, rate-sensitive, and defensive — benefit from cheaper financing costs when front end falls.

In a slowing economy, defensive yield sectors like utilities tend to outperform cyclicals.

The call for cuts only from Dec 2025 means steepener PnL may be gradual until market repricing happens. Positioning early could be a carry cost, but increases potential upside when narrative shifts.
