For the U.S. 2s10s Steepener
Goal: Show you understand the mechanics of post-inversion steepening and front-end sensitivity to Fed policy.

“Given how long the 2s10s inversion has persisted, do you think the next steepening move is more likely to come from the front end falling or the long end selling off?”

“How much of the current long-end level do you think is term premium versus growth expectations — and how would that change the steepening path?”

“With Treasury supply so heavy at the long end, could we see a scenario where steepening is bear-led rather than bull-led?”

“When you think about timing a steepener, do you wait for the first Fed cut, or do you put it on as soon as the market starts pricing them in?”

For the Japan JGB 5s30s Steepener
Goal: Signal awareness of BoJ policy evolution and yield curve control unwind.

“Do you think the BoJ can steepen the curve sustainably without triggering disruptive volatility in the long end?”

“How much of the recent 30y JGB move do you think is domestic real-money demand adjusting to YCC changes, versus foreign flows reacting to rate differentials?”

“If wage growth momentum stalls, would you expect the steepening trade to unwind, or would fiscal issuance still keep the long end under pressure?”

“In your experience, does the Japan curve steepen more from policy shifts or from changes in global term premium?”

For the Brazil 2s10s Steepener
Goal: Show you understand EM curve drivers — monetary easing vs fiscal supply risk.

“When you’re trading a steepener in an EM like Brazil, how do you weigh the monetary policy easing effect at the front end against fiscal supply risk at the long end?”

“Do you think foreign investor positioning in DI futures has a big impact on curve shape, or is it mostly driven by local real-money accounts?”

“How sensitive is the Brazil curve to U.S. rates right now — could a UST sell-off trigger a bear steepener even as the BCB cuts?”

“Historically, have you found that steepeners in Brazil perform best in the early, middle, or late stages of an easing cycle?”





Generic Macro Rates Conversation Starters
1. Curve Shape & Steepeners

“I was reading one note saying post-inversion steepening is almost always bull-led as the Fed cuts, but another argued that with heavy long-end supply this time it could be bear-led. How do you see it playing out?”

“Some research I saw suggested the 2s10s tends to steepen 6–9 months before the first Fed cut, but another house said you don’t get a clean move until after. Which matches your experience?”

2. Term Premium & Long-End Supply

“I read a piece saying most of the rise in 10y yields this year has been term premium, but another desk was saying it’s still mostly real yields. Do you think term premium is really back in a meaningful way?”

“One bank was saying Treasury supply is now the dominant driver of the long end, but another said demand from pensions is still strong enough to absorb it. What’s your take?”

3. Japan & Yield Curve Control

“Some analysts think removing YCC will steepen the JGB curve a lot, others think it’s mostly priced in already. How much do you think is left to go?”

“I read one view that BoJ hikes will pull up the whole curve, but another that long-end yields will move more than the short end because of fiscal supply. Which camp do you lean towards?”

4. EM Curves

“I saw research saying EM steepeners usually perform best mid-cycle when front-end cuts start, but another house argued you get the biggest moves late in the cycle. How do you think about that timing?”

“One note I read said Brazil’s long end is glued by fiscal risk, another argued global rates are a bigger swing factor. Which one do you see as more important right now?”

5. Macro Crossovers

“One strategist was saying U.S. curve shape is mostly a domestic story, another argued it’s now more linked to global term premium moves. Do you think the U.S. curve is really that globalised?”

“I saw a view that central banks’ QT programs are already baked into curves, but another research piece said balance sheet runoff still has a big steepening impact ahead. What’s your read?”
