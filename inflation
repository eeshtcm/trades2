1. “How do you separate macro-driven breakeven moves from flow-driven moves?”
Why it’s smart: Shows you understand that not all price action comes from fundamentals — client flows, auctions, and repo specials can distort prices.
What you’ll learn: How traders use indicators (e.g., real yield changes, energy moves, flow trackers) to attribute moves.

2. “When you trade a breakeven view, how do you decide between expressing it in swaps vs linkers?”
Why it’s smart: This gets at the instrument choice decision — liquidity, basis risk, balance sheet use, carry, repo.
What you’ll learn: How desks weigh cash–swap basis, balance sheet constraints, and execution costs.

3. “What role do carry and seasonality play in your short-term P&L planning?”
Why it’s smart: Carry and seasonality are huge in inflation trading, especially for YoY swaps.
What you’ll learn: How the desk calculates expected carry from index lags, base effects, and seasonal patterns — and how that shapes positioning even without a macro view.

4. “How do you think about hedging real-rate risk when running a breakeven trade?”
Why it’s smart: Shows you know breakevens combine nominal and real yields — unhedged, you’re taking both.
What you’ll learn: Which instruments (nominal bonds, IRS, futures) they use to neutralise real-rate DV01.

5. “How do energy markets feed into your inflation pricing models?”
Why it’s smart: Energy (especially oil and gas) is a key short-term driver of headline CPI.
What you’ll learn: How traders map oil futures curves and gasoline cracks into CPI forecasts, and which months in the index they hit.

6. “What’s the biggest difference in trading near-term inflation vs long-term inflation expectations?”
Why it’s smart: It signals you understand that short maturities are about known prints & carry, while long maturities reflect structural macro views.
What you’ll learn: The different risks (e.g., liquidity, macro data vs pension flows) and how curve trades are set up.

7. “How do you monitor and trade the cash–swap breakeven basis?”
Why it’s smart: The cash–swap basis is an active RV area — repo, collateral, and liquidity all matter.
What you’ll learn: How to spot rich/cheap linkers vs swaps and when it’s worth trading the basis.

8. “What’s your process for updating your inflation forecast after each CPI print?”
Why it’s smart: It’s practical and touches their daily workflow.
What you’ll learn: How quickly they incorporate data into models, and how they use surprises vs consensus to adjust trades.

9. “How does the index lag and interpolation convention affect pricing in swaps?”
Why it’s smart: Lags are a technical but crucial part of swap PV.
What you’ll learn: How a trader values swaps with 2–3 month publication lags and how that changes near-term pricing.

10. “When deciding on a curve trade (e.g., 5s10s breakeven steepener), what makes you confident it’s dislocated?”
Why it’s smart: Gets into their framework for term structure RV — whether they compare to macro drivers, historical ranges, or carry-adjusted levels.
What you’ll learn: How they think about curve “fair value” and timing.

1. “How do you model and apply the convexity adjustment between ZCIS and YoY swaps?”
Why it’s technical: Zero-coupon inflation swaps (ZCIS) and Year-on-Year swaps aren’t directly comparable — YoY embeds compounding and seasonal convexity.

What you’ll learn: How they adjust YoY forwards to match ZC pricing, and the size of that adjustment in current markets.

2. “What’s the current market-implied forward CPI path from the ZCIS curve, and how do you strip it?”
Why it’s technical: Stripping forward inflation from ZCIS par rates involves bootstrapping and discounting, plus index lag adjustments.

What you’ll learn: How they translate swap quotes into month-by-month CPI forecasts.

3. “How do you compute breakeven DV01 and inflation convexity for a given maturity?”
Why it’s technical: Inflation DV01 is the sensitivity to a 1bp move in the breakeven rate, which depends on maturity, discount factors, and indexation.

What you’ll learn: The desk’s rule-of-thumb DV01s for key points, and how convexity risk is tracked in risk systems.

4. “When pricing inflation swaps, how do you handle the index publication lag and daily interpolation?”
Why it’s technical: These conventions shift the PV of near-term swaps because part of the index path is already fixed and part is floating.

What you’ll learn: How they separate known vs unknown CPI in pricing models.

5. “How do you adjust breakeven levels for carry when comparing points on the curve?”
Why it’s technical: Raw breakevens can be misleading if one maturity has heavy positive/negative carry from base effects or seasonality.

What you’ll learn: How to compute carry-adjusted breakevens, and when they override headline levels.

6. “How do you back out the cash–swap breakeven basis and decompose what’s driving it?”
Why it’s technical: Basis = cash BEI – swap BEI. It can move due to repo specials, collateral discounting, bond liquidity, or convexity.

What you’ll learn: Which technicals are most important now, and whether they’re trading that basis.

7. “How do you manage inflation basis risk across currencies (e.g., EUR HICPxT vs French CPI)?”
Why it’s technical: Different inflation indices have slightly different dynamics; basis swaps trade that spread.

What you’ll learn: How they measure and hedge cross-index correlation risk.

8. “What inputs do you use to forecast the next 12 months of CPI, and how do you translate that into a trade?”
Why it’s technical: Traders often build bottom-up forecasts from energy curves, food prices, wages, core services.

What you’ll learn: How they link fundamental forecasts to specific maturities and instruments.

9. “How do you estimate the real-rate component in a linker price given current swap and OIS curves?”
Why it’s technical: Real yield = nominal yield – breakeven; but discounting, asset-swap spreads, and liquidity premiums complicate the decomposition.

What you’ll learn: How they strip real rates from market prices consistently.

10. “How do you think about gamma and vega in inflation options, and what’s the smile/skew telling you now?”
Why it’s technical: Inflation caps/floors have different implied vol smiles depending on deflation risk vs upside tails.

What you’ll learn: How option vol markets are pricing inflation tail risks.
